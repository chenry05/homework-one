    <p><img src="assets/images/mynewimage.png" alt="Carolyn's image"> I believe one word to describes me best is creative. At one time I made all of the clothing I wore. I have done crafts of every stripe, knitting, crocketing, macrame, basket weaving, card design and many more. I love to work with power tools and am an avid home "improvementor". I have built computers. I have beta-tested softward for MicroSoft. I wish I had the time to get back to that. Computer code has always facinated me although this is the first in-depth coding class that I have taken.</p>
    <p>I love to travel and I am a wanderer. I was in Jamaica on year and on one of my journeys when I saw an interesting settlement. I was on my where there but was warned by a policeman that "I should go down there". After this class is over I plan to travel with some very good friends to Ghana. Heaven only knows where I might wind up.</p>
    <p>I went into the technology field after spending many years in health care. I heard "We have to do more with less" one time too many. I spent many hours being called in from some pleasurable activity due to short staffing. </p>
